    <p>Started this log, which will act as a sort of personal journal.<br>
      <br>
    I'll update daily (assuming I can). I'll include things I've done to better
    myself such as work on this website, promotions, reading books, etc. This
    might be a dumb idea for a CV but if anyone is interested, it'll be here.
    Plus the daily practice will be nice. So, admittedly, today has been wasted
    playing video games and watching YouTube. Hey, I think I deserved to have
    Labor Day off and enjoy myself a little. I'll be back at it again tomorrow.</p></li>
